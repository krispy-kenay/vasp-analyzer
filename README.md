# VASP analyzer

## Features

- Spin-Splitting Calculations: This Python package simplifies analysis of antiferromagnetic materials simulated with VASP. It extracts relevant data from vasprun.xml files, including INCAR parameters, eigenvalues (EIGENVAL), density of states (DOSCAR), and projected electronic density of states (PROCAR).
- Data Extraction and Processing: Focus on the core functionalities â€“ loading specific sections of vasprun.xml for efficient data retrieval.
- Visualization: Generate band structure and density of states (DOS) plots to visualize the electronic behavior of your antiferromagnets.
- Spin-Splitting Calculations: Calculate the spin-splitting values for deeper insights into the magnetic properties of your materials.

## Get-started
